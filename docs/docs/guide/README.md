# Introduction

Godot Rust CLI is a simple command line interface to help you create and update Rust components for your Godot projects.

Using Rust in your Godot project is great for performance critical code and with Godot Rust CLI, you can create your entire project in Rust or you can mix it with new or existing gdscript.

**Note:** Godot Rust CLI is the successor to [Godot Rust Helper](https://github.com/robertcorponoi/godot_rust_helper). Godot Rust CLI aims to be much more simple, more strict, and it mirrors the major and minor versioning of the gdnative package so that upgrades are easy.
